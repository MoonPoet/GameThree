helpOne.msg=A long time ago, the Matsumoto clan was attacked by four indescribable monsters and their evil army. \
  In order to stop the invaders, Sensei-Matsumoto joined forces with the Queen of the Forest, the Sorceress Marlena. \
  Combining the most powerful spells with the secrets of the ancestral martial arts, the monsters were defeated and the \
  whole army was seized and locked in cages in deep underground dungeons. \
  As the years passed, friendship between Matsumoto and Marlena blossomed into romance and a baby boy named Drako \
  was born as the fruit and bond of their marriage. \
  Anticipating the worst, both parents trained their son in all manner of combat and sorcery skills. \
  Today this nightmare has come true and the forces of darkness are free again. You and Drako are the only hope. \
  Your mission is to travel around the four worlds to destroy this army and its commanders. Throughout this \
  dangerous adventure, you will be able to pick up different items left there by Matsumoto and Marlena to help you. \
  Let strength and courage guide you both to succeed. Good luck brave warriors!
